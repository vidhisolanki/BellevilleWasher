   abstract = {The conical disk spring, often known after the original patentee as the Belleville Washer, has considerable potentialities for cushioning purposes, but its use in this country has been restricted owing to the lack of published information regarding the load-deflexion and stress-deflexion relations obtaining.The circular conical disk of constant thickness, with a concentric hole and under central loading, is analysed in theory and design. Part I deals with theoretical aspects of the single disk, shows that a range of load-deflexion curves can be obtained (the shape of the curve depending on the ratio of the free camber to the thickness of the disk) and develops the relation between the distribution of internal stress and the ratio of the outside diameter of the disk to the inside diameter (showing that for economic utilization of space and material this ratio should not be more than two). Part II deals with the design of nests of disk springs, with particular reference to the use of these nests for buffering duties outside those for which helical springs can be easily employed. A figure for the maximum permissible calculated stress is suggested and a set of simple formulae which facilitate rapid design is developed from a consideration of the storage of energy under deflexion.},

   abstract = {"This book on dynamics of structures is conceived as a textbook for courses in civil engineering. It includes many topics in the theory of structural dynamics, and applications of this theory to earthquake analysis, response, design, and evaluation of structures. No prior knowledge of structural dynamics is assumed in order to make this book suitable for the reader learning the subject for the first time. The presentation is sufficiently detailed and carefully integrated by cross-referencing to make the book suitable for self-study. This feature of the book, combined with a practically motivated selection of topics, should interest professional engineers, especially those concerned with analysis and design of structures in earthquake country. In developing this book, much emphasis has been placed on making structural dynamics easier to learn by students and professional engineers because many find this subject to be difficult. To achieve this goal, the presentation has been structured around several features: The mathematics is kept as simple as each topic will permit. Analytical procedures are summarized to emphasize the key steps and to facilitate their implementation by the reader. These procedures are illustrated by over 125 worked-out examples, including many comprehensive and realistic examples where the physical interpretation of results is stressed. Some 600 figures have been carefully designed and executed to be pedagogically effective; many of them involve extensive computer simulations of dynamic response of structures. Photographs of structures and structural motions recorded during earthquakes are included to relate the presentation to the real world"--},

   abstract = {Seismic isolation technology is well established within the building industry and has frequently been employed to provide superior seismic protection for buildings that are required to remain fully functional after an earthquake. Seattle City Light is among the first utilities in the world to utilize seismic isolation to protect a new high voltage transformer in a working substation. Seismic isolation is an ideal solution for protecting this type of heavy, expensive, and fragile equipment from earthquake damage. The process of seismically isolating the transformer included the following steps: obtaining in-house approval; analysis; preparing the existing foundation for the isolation system; addressing interconnection of the transformer to both underground and overhead lines; procuring and testing isolation devices; and construction of pier, isolation bearings, float slab, and transformer embed plates. The total construction schedule was four months, and the transformer was energized in November of 2014. Those interested in using seismic base isolation will find that it is not only cutting edge technology but cost effective and practical for actual implementation. In many ways, it diminishes the complexity of foundation design and provides actual confidence that the equipment will achieve the post disaster operational performance goal.},

   abstract = {This study sheds considerable light on the potential of superelastic shape memory alloy Belleville washers for innovative seismic resisting applications. A series of experimental studies were conducted on washers with different stack combinations under varying temperatures and loading scenarios. The washers showed satisfactory self-centring and energy dissipation capacities at room temperature, although slight degradations of the hysteretic responses accompanied by residual deformations were induced. The hysteretic loops became stable after a few number of cycles, indicating good repeatability. The washers also showed good flexibility in terms of load resistance and deformation, which could be easily varied via changes in the stack combination. Compromised self-centring responses were observed at temperatures below 0 degrees C or above 40 degrees C, and a numerical study, validated by the experimental results, was adopted to further investigate the deformation mechanism of the washers. A further phenomenological model, taking account of the degradation effects under varied temperatures, was developed to enable effective and accurate simulation of devices incorporating the washers. Good agreements were observed between the test and simulation results, and the model was shown to have good numerical robustness for wide engineering applications.},

We proposed a structural concept of a vertical component isolation system, assuming a building adopting a horizontal base isolation system. In this concept, a reactor vessel and major primary components are suspended from a large common deck supported by isolation devices consisting of large coned disk springs. In order to verify the isolation performance of the vertical component isolation system, 1/8 series of shaking table tests using a scale model were conducted. The test model was composed of 4 vertical isolation devices, common deck and horizontal load suspension system. For the design earthquake, the system smoothly operated, and sufficient isolation characteristics were shown. The simulation analysis results matched well the test results, so the validity of the design technique was able to be verified. As the result, the prospect that the vertical isolation system applied to the FBR plant could technically realize was obtained.},

   abstract = {Belleville springs are widely used in a variety of mechanical systems. Recent advances in the field of multi-stable structures suggest that these conical axisymmetric washers may be extremely useful as bistable building blocks for multi-stable architected metamaterials. In this paper, we examine the ability of existing analytical models to accurately predict the bistable behavior of Belleville springs, namely, a nonmonotonous force-displacement relation with two branches of positive stiffness separated by a branch of negative stiffness. By comparing with results of finite element (FE) simulations, we find that current analytical models may suffer from significant inaccuracies associated with the assumption of rigid rotation. According to this assumption, adopted by all analytical models of Belleville springs, the cross section of the spring rotates without bending, i.e., maintains zero curvature as the spring deforms. Motivated by this insight, we relax the rigid-rotation assumption and approximate the radial displacement field by a linear relation in terms of the distance from the spring axis. We find, based on extensive finite element simulations, that the functional dependence of the radial displacement on the geometry of the springs is indifferent to the stage of deformation and can be expressed in terms of three geometrical parameters. These findings enable us to derive closed-form expressions that are simple and straightforward to use, yet are significantly more accurate than existing analytical models.},

As part of a long-term seismic mitigation program, BPA sponsors research into ways to minimize the vulnerability of existing electrical substation equipment. Passive energy dissipation devices add supplemental damping to improve the dynamic response of structures to earthquakes. One such mechanism, a friction spring damping device, utilizes a primary and secondary set of self-centering ring springs installed around a single end-mount load shaft to reduce peak accelerations. The adaptation of this technology to seismically retrofit existing high-voltage substation equipment single-pedestal support stand is the subject of this paper. Dynamic properties were determined from force-displacement and vibration tests. Full-scale earthquake transient tests conducted on a support stand equipped with friction spring devices resulted in substantial reductions of the in-plane peak accelerations in comparison to tests performed without the friction spring devices.},

The device is designed to allow Nitinol forms, such as helical springs or Belleville washers, to be used in compression. The device allows both overall extension (tension) and compression while subjecting the Nitinol to an optimum deformation mode. It is possible, due to the versatility of the design, to adjust the force and stroke of the device without changing the overall configuration. This new device is subjected to a cyclic loading protocol that tests the Nitinol element's ability to recover large deformations. The effect of different Nitinol configurations and a cyclic loading history are evaluated in the study. The results show that Nitinol helical springs produce good recentering and damping behavior while Nitinol Belleville washers show good potential to form the basis for a Nitinol damping device.},

The SMA Belleville spring washers were used to minimize the axial deformation of the high strength bolts used in the connection and to provide additional energy dissipation and self-centering abilities. Tension coupon tests of the SMA plates with varied dimensions were conducted to examine the fundamental mechanical properties of the SMA plates. The cyclic behavior of the SMA Belleville spring washers was also examined experimentally. Test results showed that the connection exhibited flag-shaped hysteretic responses with negligible residual deformation in a wide drift spectrum, and the skeleton curve with multi-stage characteristics was observed. The applied load-drift responses of the connection indicated that the SMA plates have developed significant inelastic deformations, which were able to offer self-centering capacity and energy dissipation concurrently.},

   abstract = {Disc springs have excellent ability to absorb and dissipate energy, and are widely used as basic vibration isolation units in the design of vibration isolators for naval power systems. Focusing on the effect of friction on disc springs, a mechanical model of disc springs considering asymmetric frictional boundary is developed. The additional load to overcome the Coulomb friction damping is derived analytically by the energy method. Finite element analysis of disc springs is carried out and the results for large and small frictional conditions are compared with the theoretical results. Quasi-static experiments on disc springs are carried out and the proposed method is further validated. The results show that the analytical model based on energy method can describe the load–displacement characteristics of disc springs and their combinations under symmetric and asymmetric frictional boundaries accurately. Based on the analytical solution, the influence of the structural parameters of the disc springs on the damping effect is investigated. The stiffness and damping of disc springs are linearly related to the friction coefficient. In addition, the magnitude of the effect of asymmetry of the boundary friction on the mechanical properties of the disc springs varies with the structural parameters.},
